    "This notebook provided a walkthrough of the `frd_client` library, covering installation, initialization, fetching updates, and loading data for various financial instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "- Initialize `FrdClient`, `MetadataStore`, and `UpdateScheduler` with your User ID and desired paths.\n",
    "- Use `UpdateScheduler` (`run_daily()`, `run_weekly()`, `run_monthly()`) to keep your local data current.\n",
    "- Use `load_dataframe()` to easily load data into Pandas DataFrames, specifying the asset type and relevant parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here, you can integrate `frd_client` into your quantitative models, analytics scripts, or data dashboards. Remember to replace placeholder values like `\"YOUR_USER_ID\"` and example ticker symbols with your actual information.\n",
